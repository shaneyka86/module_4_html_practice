# HTML Project Instructions

This README file outlines the steps and requirements for creating a basic HTML project.

## Part 1: Form Creation

Create a Basic Contact Form with the following fields:
- **Name** (text input)
- **Email** (email input)
- **Message** (textarea)
- **Submit button**

Bonus: Add a radio button group asking how the user found the site (e.g., Google, Social Media).

## Part 2: Table Structure

Create a Table that displays some sample product data:
- **Columns:** Product Name, Price, and Quantity.
- **Rows:** At least 3 products with their respective details.

Bonus: Add a header row to label the columns.

## Part 3: Navigation Bar

Create a Simple Navigation Bar with the following links:
- Home
- About
- Contact

Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) to organize the links.

## Part 4: Adding Images

Add a Placeholder Image (use [https://placehold.co/300x200](https://placehold.co/300x200)).
Bonus: Add a second image with a rounded border using the `style` attribute.

## Project Requirements:

### User Interface (UI):
- Build a complete HTML page using valid HTML5 syntax.
- Use semantic elements such as `<nav>`, `<form>`, and `<table>` where appropriate.

### Content Structure:
- Include all required components: a form, table, navigation bar, and at least one image.

### Code Quality:
- Properly indent and organize your HTML code for readability.
- Add comments to explain key sections where necessary.

### Styling:
- Use inline styles or the `<style>` section to apply simple visual enhancements, such as rounded borders.

### Browser Compatibility:
- Ensure the page is responsive by using the viewport meta tag.
- Test the page in different browsers to confirm proper rendering.
